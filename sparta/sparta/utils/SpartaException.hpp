/*!
 * \brief Utility for throwing an exception ONLY if there is not already an
 * uncaught exception causing the stack to unwind. This is useful in destructors
 * or other shutdown operations when testing for premature shutdown conditions.
 * Often, there are shutdown errors if an exception in the program causes
 * premature destruction and throwing a new exception during shutdown would mask
 * the root cause,
 * \warning this should typically ONLY be used for Fatal destructor errors
 * \deprecated this should not be used because std::uncaught_exception() can not
 *             fully prevent ending up in a double-exception case as explained in
 *             https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/destructors-that-throw/
