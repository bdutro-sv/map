/*!
 * \class ExpiringExpressionTrigger
 *
 * \brief ExpressionTrigger's reuse classes such as SingleTrigger
 * (CounterTrigger, CycleTrigger, TimeTrigger) and others such as
 * NotificationTrigger under the hood. Some of these other classes
 * cannot safely be deleted during simulation as they can leave
 * dangling this/back-pointers in the TriggerManager singleton.
 * ExpiringExpressionTrigger is used in order to allow these
 * ExpressionTrigger's to be "destroyed" during simulation, but
 * instead of actually being deallocated, they are simply removed
 * (deactivated) from the TriggerManager and cleared out of any
 * other data structures that use trigger back pointers in a
 * similar way to what TriggerManager does.
 *
 * Here is example code which causes problems during simulation,
 * notably valgrind failures:
 *
 *     \code
 *         unique_ptr<ExpressionTrigger> trig(new ...)
 *             --- sim loop running ---
 *         trig.reset(new ...)
 *             --- sim loop still running ---
 *     \endcode
 *
 * Here is code which allows the same thing, but safely removes
 * the trigger from the TriggerManager / other data structures
 * without actually deallocating the ExpressionTrigger:
 *
 *     \code
 *         ExpiringExpressionTrigger trig(new ...)
 *             --- sim loop running ---
 *         trig.reset(new ...)
 *             --- sim loop still running ---
 *     \endcode
