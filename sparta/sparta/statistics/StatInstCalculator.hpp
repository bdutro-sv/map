/*
 * \brief This class is a wrapper around user-implemented
 * code (SpartaHandler's) that calculate the value of a SPARTA
 * statistic on demand. There are cases where expressing
 * a statistic equation in a single std::string is not
 * very easy to do - if it were easily written out in
 * a single string, you could use StatisticDef's to get
 * the statistic values in reports as usual.
 *
 * StatisticInstance's have a constructor overload which
 * takes one of these StatInstCalculator objects, and
 * when the reporting infrastructure calls 'SI::getValue()'
 * it will invoke the user's SpartaHandler to retrieve the
 * value.
